# How to help us

## Enrolling in our Beta Program

You probably heard of Beta Programs before, where developers send a certain group of people a version before it releases so they receive feedback and get informed about bugs that haven't been discovered by their team yet. That is exactly what we do at Companion.\
In order to get new versions before it releases to everyone, you must enroll in our Beta Program by creating a Ticket in [our Discord ](https://discord.cpn.ac)whenever we announce applications are open.\
If the last message in `#announcements` is not a Beta-related announcement, applications are most likely closed.

## Reporting bugs

Even if you are not enrolled in our Beta Program, if you find a bug or something that doesn't seem correct. Please open a ticket as soon as possible, so we can fix any issues you might encounter.

## Suggestions

We really appreciate suggestions and try to add every feature we find useful and users ask for.\
In order to create a suggestion, head to our Discord and check the `#suggestions` channel, we often wipe it, so it might seem dead, but please post your suggestion, we check them!

## Becoming a Staff Member

This one is not really an option if you don't have any previous experience working with screensharing-related projects and/or plan on having a short-term relationship with Companion.

We don't often look for new members because our team is mostly made up of people we trust a lot, and that has been engaged in many-year-long relationships with us.
